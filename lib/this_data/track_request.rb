# Include ThisData::TrackRequest in your ApplicationController to get a handy

# `request` and `ThisData.configuration.user_method`
#
module ThisData
  module TrackRequest
    class ThisDataTrackError < StandardError; end

    # Will pull request and user details from the controller, and send an event
    # to ThisData.
    # Arguments:
    #   verb: (String, Required). Defaults to ThisData::Verbs::LOG_IN.
    #   user: (Object, Optional). If you want to override the user record
    #     that we would usually fetch, you can pass it here.
    #     Unless a user is specified here we'll attempt to get the user record
    #       as specified in the ThisData gem configuration. This defaults to
    #       `current_user`.
    #     The object must respond to at least
    #       `ThisData.configuration.user_id_method`, which defaults to `id`.
    #   authenticated: (Boolean, Optional, default nil). Used to indicate
    #     whether a user is authenticated or not. By default we assume that if
    #     there is a user specified then they are authenticated, but in some
    #     cases (like a log-in-denied event) you might want to track the user
    #     but tell us that they are not authenticated.
    #     In these situations you should set `authenticated` to false.
