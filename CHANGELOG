# 0.1.3

In the `ThisData::TrackRequest` module, make tracking a bit easier especially
in the case where `current_user` will return nil - e.g. when someone failed to
log in to that account.

Also update the documentation and default configuration options to better enable
people getting started with the ThisData gem.

# 0.1.2

Fix a typo in the configuration generator (`asyc` instead of `async`)

# 0.1.1

Makes Track requests asynchronous by default.

# 0.1.0
